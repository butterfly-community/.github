## Butterfly

We are building core infrastructure connecting blockchain with physical devices.

### Butterfly OSKey

OSKey is an open hardware wallet, free from vendor lock-in, supporting hundreds of chips from multiple manufacturers. The minimum supported chip costs only $0.3.

We created our own board for demos - similar to others but more refined and production-ready.
